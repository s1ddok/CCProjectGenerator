# CCProjectGenerator

This tool is currently in beta status and introduced since cocos2d-objc 3.5. It is made for easy creating template projects.
As of XCTemplates are unsupported, undocumented by Apple and are just a hell on the earth, I decided to stick to manual project generation, as of it is more flexible for us and less painful.

Some of project-generation code was extracted from SpriteBuilder repo.
